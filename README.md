In this project, I did the following:
- Explored the dataset's shape and information to understand its structure. Checked for missing values and converted columns to the correct data types. Used pandas to handle data.
- Calculated the overall churn rate and visualized it using a bar chart. Analyzed churn rates based on customer tenure, finding a significant decrease in churn as tenure increases. Used matplotlib for visualization.
- Built a linear regression model to predict churn rate based on tenure. The model showed a strong correlation (R-squared value of 0.83) between tenure and churn rate. Used scipy.stats for the linear regression analysis.
- Analyzed churn rates for different Telco services like Phone Service, Online Security, and Streaming TV. Identified services with higher churn rates, providing insights for targeted improvements.
- Investigated churn rates for customers using multiple Telco services. Found that customers with 2 services had the highest churn rate, suggesting a need for bundled service offerings or enhanced retention strategies.
- Provided actionable recommendations for Telco, such as focusing on new customers for retention efforts, improving services with high churn rates, and promoting bundled service offerings based on the analysis.
